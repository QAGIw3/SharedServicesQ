+ - **Purpose**: Unified data platform with federation, quality, and governance
+ - **Key Services**: Data Platform, Graph Intelligence, Analytics, Workflow Service
+ - **Target Market**: Enterprise data teams, business analysts, data engineers
+ - **Deployment**: Shared infrastructure with data zone isolation
+ 
+ ### 5. **Collaboration Workspace** 👥
+ **Real-time collaboration for creative and technical work**
+ - **Purpose**: Enable teams to collaborate on CAD, simulations, and other workloads
+ - **Key Services**: Collaboration Platform, State Management, Compute Allocation
+ - **Target Market**: Engineering teams, designers, research collaborators
+ - **Deployment**: Shared infrastructure with edge capabilities
+ 
+ ### 6. **Compliance Command Center** 🛡️
+ **Regulatory compliance and governance**
+ - **Purpose**: KYC/AML, governance, and regulatory reporting
+ - **Key Services**: Compliance Service, Governance Service, Verifiable Credentials
+ - **Target Market**: Financial institutions, regulated industries, DAOs
+ - **Deployment**: Isolated infrastructure for security and compliance
+ 
+ ### 7. **Platform Core Services** ⚙️
+ **Shared infrastructure services**
+ - **Purpose**: Authentication, event routing, and resource provisioning
+ - **Included**: Auth Service, Event Router, Provisioning Service
+ - **Note**: Included with all application deployments
+ 
+ ## Key Benefits of the Suite Architecture
+ 
+ ### 1. **Deployment Flexibility**
+ - Applications can run together in a shared cluster for cost efficiency
+ - Sensitive applications (TradeStream, Compliance) can run in isolated environments
+ - Edge deployment options for latency-sensitive use cases
+ 
+ ### 2. **Data Sovereignty**
+ - Shared data infrastructure for non-sensitive operational data
+ - Isolated, encrypted storage for financial and compliance data
+ - Federated queries across data stores with proper authorization
+ 
+ ### 3. **Identity Options**
+ - Unified SSO across all applications (optional)
+ - Application-specific authentication when required
+ - Federation between central and app-specific identity providers
+ 
+ ### 4. **Deep Integration**
+ - Real-time event streaming between applications via Apache Pulsar
+ - Cross-application API calls with sub-100ms latency
+ - Shared caching layer for frequently accessed data
+ 
+ ### 5. **Flexible Packaging**
+ - **Starter**: Digital Asset Nexus + Basic Analytics ($X/month)
+ - **Professional**: Asset + Intelligence + DataVerse + Collaboration ($XX/month)
+ - **Enterprise**: All applications with premium support ($XXX/month)
+ - **À la carte**: Individual application licensing
+ 
+ ## Technical Architecture Highlights
+ 
+ ### Event-Driven Integration
+ - Apache Pulsar event mesh connects all applications
+ - Events routed based on application subscriptions
+ - Schema evolution support for backward compatibility
+ 
+ ### Security Architecture
+ - Zero-trust security model with mTLS between services
+ - Fine-grained RBAC with attribute-based policies
+ - Encryption at rest for all sensitive data
+ - Separate security zones for different data classifications
+ 
+ ### Performance Targets
+ - **Cross-app latency**: <100ms
+ - **Event propagation**: <10ms
+ - **Availability**: 99.99% per application
+ - **Scale**: 100K+ concurrent users
+
