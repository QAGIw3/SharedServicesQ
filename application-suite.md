+ # PlatformQ Application Suite Architecture
+ 
+ ## Executive Summary
+ 
+ This document outlines the architectural breakdown of PlatformQ from a monolithic platform into a modular suite of interconnected applications. The design supports flexible deployment models, data sovereignty, optional SSO, and deep real-time integration while maintaining the ability to package and sell applications individually or as bundles.
+ 
+ ## Core Design Principles
+ 
+ ### 1. Deployment Flexibility
+ - **Shared Kubernetes Clusters**: Core services and tightly coupled applications share infrastructure
+ - **Standalone Deployments**: Applications handling sensitive data or requiring isolation run independently
+ - **Edge Deployments**: Lightweight versions for edge computing scenarios
+ 
+ ### 2. Data Architecture
+ - **Shared Data Platform**: Non-sensitive operational data uses common infrastructure
+ - **Isolated Data Stores**: Financial, compliance, and PII data in separate, encrypted stores
+ - **Federated Queries**: Apache Trino enables cross-application queries with proper authorization
+ 
+ ### 3. Identity & Access
+ - **Hybrid Identity Provider**: Central auth service with optional federation
+ - **Application-Specific Auth**: Apps can maintain their own user stores while federating with central auth
+ - **Context Propagation**: Security context flows seamlessly across applications
+ 
+ ### 4. Integration Architecture
+ - **Event Mesh**: Apache Pulsar provides real-time event streaming
+ - **API Gateway**: Kong manages external API access with rate limiting
